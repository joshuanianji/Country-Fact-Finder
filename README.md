# CIA FACT FINDER

This is my project for the CIA fact finder!

After uploading text files containing information regarding the information on countries (contained in the `Info/` folder), the application will direct you to a page where the user can search for a country or look at indivudual country data, such as birth rate, death rate, GDP, population and unemployment.

The compiled code is in HTML as always for elm projects, and the actual code is in the .elm files.

## How To Use this:

To look at the project, first make sure you have Elm installed. To fiddle with the code, go to the elm files and change it around and save them. To compile the code again use the elm-make function or use elm-reactor to see your code in the browser, compiled real time. as you save. [More info here](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html)
