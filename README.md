# CIA FACT FINDER

This is my project for the CIA fact finder! I'll maybe put more info later but for right now I just wanna upload it lol.

The compiled code is in HTML as always for elm projects, and the actuall code is in the .elm files.

## How To Use this:

To look at the project, just open up the HTML file on a browser! To fiddle with the code, just go to the elm files and change it around and save them. To compile the code again use the elm-make function or use elm-reactor to see your code in the browser, compiled real time.
