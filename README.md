# CIA FACT FINDER

This is my project for the CIA fact finder!

After uploading text files containing information regarding the information on countries (contained in the `Info/` folder), the application will direct you to a page where the user can search for a country or look at indivudual country data, such as birth rate, death rate, GDP, population and unemployment.

## How To Use this:

You can either compile it yourself or [look at it on my website](http://joshuaji.com/projects/fact-finder)

To look at the project, first make sure you have Elm installed. To fiddle with the code, go to the elm files and change it around and save them. To compile the code, execute `elm-live src/Main.elm --pushstate -- --output=elm.js` into the terminal.


Oh yeah you'll need the text filed to upload lol. I just made a [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hYL_WkKd_4tzpf67TMO5fr9Dv68nrTw1?usp=sharing) for now lol.
